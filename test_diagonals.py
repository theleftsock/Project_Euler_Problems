#  0  1  2  3  4 ...
# -1  0  1  2  3
# -2 -1  0  1  2
# -3 -2 -1  0  1

# You wanted lower-left-to-upper-right and upper-left-to-lower-right diagonals.
#
# The syntax a[slice,slice] returns a new array with elements from the sliced ranges,
# where "slice" is Python's [start[:stop[:step]] format.

# "::-1" returns the rows in reverse. ":" returns the columns as is,
# effectively vertically mirroring the original array so the wanted diagonals are
# lower-right-to-uppper-left.
#
# Then a list comprehension is used to collect all the diagonals.  The range
# is -x+1 to y (exclusive of y), so for a matrix like the example above
# (x,y) = (4,5) = -3 to 4.

# Another list comp to convert back to Python lists from numpy arrays,
# so it prints what you requested.
